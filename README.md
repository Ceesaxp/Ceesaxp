# Hi there, I'm Ceesaxp 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in building innovative solutions and contributing to open-source projects. Here's a little bit about me:

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 By day I am a VC partner, when free – I’m working on a few pet projects.
- 🌱 I’m trying to continuously learn and explore new technologies.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to building and leading teams (of software engineers and not only).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am not an engineer by education. Should have become an _accountant_ or a _financial advisor_…

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Go, Python, Perl, Ruby (now learning Zig, started many years ago with BASIC and Pascal)
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, a bit of MongoDB (actually, it is easier for me to understand SQL databses, rather than NoSQL ones…)
- **Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, Docker, AWS, Zed and JetBrains IDEA for coding (I can also do `vi` and used to live in `emacs`, but not anymore…)

## 🏆 Achievements

- Contributed to a few open-source projects.
- Developed and maintained a variety of (personal) web applications, bots, CLI tools.
- Continuously learning and improving my skills (or trying to).
